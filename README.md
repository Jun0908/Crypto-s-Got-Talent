# 🛰️ zkIoT — Zero-Knowledge Proof Framework for IoT

zkIoT is a framework enabling IoT devices to **prove compliance** (e.g. temperature range, energy usage) using **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)** —  
**without exposing raw sensor data**.  
It bridges physical sensors with blockchain verification for **trusted and privacy-preserving IoT interactions**.

## 🌐 Overview
zkIoT solves the challenge of **trust** in IoT data by providing a way to verify conditions **without revealing sensitive information**.  
This approach helps industries adopt IoT securely across use cases such as:
- **Cold chain compliance** in pharma
- **Energy consumption verification**
- **Smart mobility and EV charging**

## ⚙️ Key Features
- ✅ **Zero-Knowledge Compliance Proofs** (prove without reveal)  
- 🔐 **Hardware-secured IDs** for data authenticity  
- 🌐 **TLS/MQTT pipeline** for encrypted transport  
- ⚡ **On-chain verification** using smart contracts  

---

## 🚀 Roadmap
- Expand **real-world pilots** in energy & logistics  
- Optimize **proof generation** for edge devices  
- Publish **open-source ZK circuits** for IoT compliance  
- Integrate with **M2M smart contract transactions**
